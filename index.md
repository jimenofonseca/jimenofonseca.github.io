I am a passionate and driven leader working where management meets Information Technology. As Head of BIM at Axpo Grid, I lead the adoption of digital methods for construction and operation of power systems in one of the biggest grid operators of Switzerland. I am also co-founder and core developer of the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a fascinating energy engineering software used to optimize urban energy systems in over 20 countries. My mission is to leverage digital technologies to create solutions that add a strong value to companies.

In addition to my role at Axpo Grid, I am also a lecturer in innovation leadership at the ETH Zürich, where I mentor young engineers, managers, and computer scientists on how to bring new software products to the market. I also provide courses on software development and energy systems analysis to consultants and research teams. In the past, I have conducted several projects in the areas of data analysis, machine learning, software development, and energy systems analysis. I have a PhD in urban energy systems from the ETH Zürich, and I have completed several certifications in Information Technology and agile project management. I have also received multiple grants and awards for my academic and professional projects, including an prediction algorithm part of the 4th IPCC Report on Climate Change. I have strong skills in management and software development and I enjoy collaborating with diverse and multidisciplinary teams.

On this website, you will find more information about projects, courses, and publications. A warm welcome!

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
